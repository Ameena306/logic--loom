About   
  It is a multiple choice quiz game.There are multliple number of questions that we can answer and it will help us to improve our knowledge.we can play it like a game. We used html and css to build its user interface.We used java script to implement its backend.And then we pushed it into github.We used ID for creating questions and options an then created a array of question  and right answers in java script.We used loop to shuffle the questions and answers.Set design using CSS.WE use another loop to check wheather choosen option is correct.If it is correct then the mark is incremented.If not then show a message that wrong answer after the last answer there need to be show result
